# Cuby Project README

We use this Sveltekit and tailwind boilerplate throughout the whole course.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
Sprint 1 Goals
MVP Foundations

# Sprint 1

### Building the Base
We had some main goals for starting our project:

1. **Making a Plan for the MVP:** We made a detailed plan for our basic app version.
2. **Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline:** We prepared a system for coding and sharing our work smoothly.
3. **Listing Our Tasks:** We made a list of important tasks and features to work on first.
4. **Starting the App Structure:** We began building the basic setup of our app using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.
5. **Deciding on Design Rules:** We made rules for how our app should look to keep it looking neat and similar everywhere.

## Achievements in Sprint 1

Here's what we focused on doing:

1. **Getting Ready to Code:** We set up all the tools we needed to start coding.
2. **Planning Who Does What:** We decided who in the team would do each task.
3. **Choosing Main Features to Make:** We worked on:
   - Services for events
   - Services for user profiles
   - A simple starting page
   - A basic calendar
   - Basic safety features for our app

## Our Achievements in Sprint 1

### Current Product Status

- **A First Look at Our App:** We made a first version that shows some basic parts of our app.
- **Showing Our Project Plan:** We put together a presentation of our app idea, including our first version, our plans, and some early designs.

### Work We Finished

- **Making Our MVP Plan:** We had meetings to make a clear plan for our basic app.
- **Setting Up for Coding:** We got our coding space ready, especially for SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.
- **Writing Our User Stories:** We wrote down stories to help us understand what our users need.
- **Building the App's Foundation:** We started the basic structure of our app.
- **Designing How Our App Looks:** We made sure our app has a consistent and nice look.

### Results

- **Putting Parts Together:** We added the first services for events and profiles to our app.
- **Starting Page Ready:** We made a simple starting page where you can go to different parts of the app.
- **Basic Calendar:** We made a simple calendar to show events.
- **Safety First:** We added some basic safety features to protect our users and our app.
- **Starting on Cuby's Physical Part:** We began working on how the Cuby device will work with our app.
- **Thinking Over Our Plan:** We looked at what we did and thought about how to improve.

## Ending Notes

We've made a good start in building our Cuby app. Everyone worked hard and did a great job. We're excited to keep working and make more progress in the next parts of our project.
