# Cuby Project README

We use this Sveltekit and tailwind boilerplate throughout the whole course.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

Sprint 1 Overview - Cuby Application
Goals for Sprint 1: MVP Foundations

In the first sprint of the Cuby project, our primary focus was on establishing the foundations for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goals set for this phase were crucial in laying the groundwork for the application’s development. Key goals included:

    Development of a Roadmap for the MVP: Crafting a clear, strategic plan that outlines the phases and key features for the MVP.

    Creation of a CI/CD Pipeline: Setting up a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to streamline development and deployment processes.

    Compilation of a Product Backlog: Assembling a backlog with prioritized features and tasks, ensuring a structured approach to tackling the project requirements.

    Setup of the Basic Structure for the Application: Establishing the fundamental architecture and framework for the application using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.

    Establishment of Styling Guidelines: Developing a consistent set of UI design principles to ensure a cohesive visual experience across the application.

Planned Activities

The sprint involved several key activities aimed at achieving these goals:

    Structuring the Development Environment: Setting up all necessary tools and frameworks to facilitate efficient development.

    Defining Tasks and Allocating Responsibilities: Clearly outlining tasks for the sprint and allocating them to appropriate team members.

    Outlining Core Features for Development: Focusing on the development of:
        Events-related microservices.
        Profile-related microservices.
        Basic home page functionality.
        Basic calendar view.
        Basic security measures.

Expected Deliverables

The deliverables expected by the end of Sprint 1 included:

    Functional Prototype: A basic version of the application showcasing essential navigation and features.

    Initial Version of the Portfolio: A portfolio presenting the project’s direction, including the prototype, user stories, and preliminary designs.

    Documented User Stories: Detailed user stories to guide and inform the development process.
