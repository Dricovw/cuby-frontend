# Cuby Project README

We use this Sveltekit and tailwind boilerplate throughout the whole course.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
Sprint 1 Goals
MVP Foundations

## Sprint 1

### MVP Foundations
Our goals for Sprint 1 were centered around establishing a solid base for the MVP:

1. **MVP Roadmap Development:** Creating a strategic roadmap for the MVP.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Creation:** Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for efficient development and deployment.
3. **Product Backlog Compilation:** Assembling a prioritized list of features and tasks.
4. **Basic Application Structure Setup:** Establishing the application's fundamental structure using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.
5. **Styling Guidelines Establishment:** Developing consistent UI design principles.

## Planned Activities

Our activities for this sprint focused on:

1. **Development Environment Structuring:** Setting up necessary tools and frameworks.
2. **Task Definition and Allocation:** Outlining and allocating sprint tasks among team members.
3. **Core Feature Development:** Developing core features such as:
   - Events-related microservices
   - Profile-related microservices
   - Basic home page functionality
   - Basic calendar view
   - Basic security measures

## Achievements in Sprint 1

### Current Product Status

- **Prototype Development:** Developed a prototype showcasing key features.
- **Project Portfolio Assembly:** Compiled a portfolio including the prototype, user stories, and preliminary designs.

### Completed Activities

- **MVP Roadmap Execution:** Conducted planning sessions for a clear MVP roadmap.
- **Development Environment Setup:** Tailored the environment for SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.
- **User Stories Writing and Refinement:** Aligned development with user needs through detailed user stories.
- **Application Structure Establishment:** Laid the foundational structure for future development.
- **Styling Guidelines Design and Application:** Implemented consistent styling guidelines.

### Outcome

- **Microservices Integration:** Integrated initial microservices for events and profiles.
- **Basic Home Page Launch:** Launched a basic home page with navigation.
- **Basic Calendar View Implementation:** Introduced a basic calendar view for event scheduling.
- **Basic Security Features Implementation:** Ensured foundational security for user data and application integrity.
- **Hardware Prototyping:** Began integrating Cuby's physical component with the software.
- **Project Trajectory Reassessment:** Adjusted the approach based on MVP feedback.

## Conclusion

This sprint has established a strong foundation for our journey towards a fully functional MVP for the Cuby application. The dedication and hard work of our team have been key in achieving these milestones, and we are excited to continue this momentum in the next phases of development.
